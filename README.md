# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using ML
In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts the medical insurance costs for individuals.

# Libraries Uesd
Pandas for loading data from dataframe, Numpy for data cleaning, seaborn for data viualization in statistical graphs and matplotlib for making some plots and graphs.

# Data Model
In this project we use Linear Regression Model for predicting statistical data.

# 3 Business Question
1. How can predictive modeling with machine learning help insurance companies better assess and manage risk in the medical insurance industry?
2. How does the average medical insurance cost vary by age group, and what insights can this provide for our insurance pricing strategy?
3. What is the distribution of policyholders based on their smoking status, and how does it impact their medical insurance costs?
